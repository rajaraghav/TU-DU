# Tu-Du

Wunderlist has been acquired by Microsoft To-Do! 
I wanted a to-do app that allows me to manage my tasks on my chrome browser! 
The tasks are distributed in three buckets, Morning, Evening, and Weekend. 
The list automatically selects bucket based on the time of day and day of the week.

## Installation
Chrome hasn't allowed me to publish this extension, but you can download the code and manually install the extension.

## Usage

1. Select Bucket.
2. Add task.
3. Click task to remove from bucket.
